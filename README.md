<!-- DESIGN -->

## Design

The MVP was heavily inspired this [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/RucpiUDcNaza94UjkbuP77/Ecommerce-App-UI-Kit-(Community)?node-id=0%3A1) design.  Our [MMP](https://www.figma.com/file/RucpiUDcNaza94UjkbuP77/Ecommerce-App-UI-Kit-(Community)?node-id=0%3A1) design is inpsired by Amazon/BestBuy single page design.

    console.log(req.body);
    const products = req.body.map((e) => ({
      price: e.default_price?.id,
      quantity: 1,
    }));

    const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
      line_items: products,
      mode: 'payment',
      success_url: 'http://localhost:8080/home',

    });

    res.json(session.url);
   }
   );
   
   ```

6. Add .env file
   ```sh
   MONGO_URI=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   STRIPE_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   PUBLISHABLE_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   SECRET=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```
### Running

1. Start Client
   ```sh
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Start Server
   ```sh
   cd ..
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Go to http://localhost:8080/ if you wanna see client, or http://localhost:4001/ for server

<!-- LEARNED -->

## What we have learned

As a team we learned to work continuously and asynchronouslyl on designing, developing, testing, deploying a full stack application with third party intergration.  We expanded our knowledge of React, Express.js, MongoDB, Node.js, Webpack, several deployment solutions, CDIC, development preview branch, mono repos, automated testing, Typescript, documentation, linting, coordinating as a team, code reviews, CSS Modules, CSS design systems, communication,  Design, Figma, managing a project(Github project) etc.

## What issues have I faced and how I resolved them

[Tell what was hard in the process of building the project. Tell about where have you feel stuck and how did you overcome this.]

**Example:**

When I tried to connect to the third-party API, I was not sure how to use fetch and what is the difference between async/await, what are Promises and how to use them. After some Googling I found out the MDN documentation about async/await and tried to use it in practice - it worked! 

<!-- ROADMAP -->

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->

## Contributing

## How Do I Contribute Using Git?

1. Clone the repository with this command if you don't have it:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/kbventures/ecommerce.git
   ```

2. Run the following command to make sure you have the latest changes on the main branch

   ```shell
   git pull
   ```

3. Create a new feature branch with a descriptive name and only make your changes here. For example, to add this README documentation I would call this branch `add-git-workflow`.

   ```shell
   git checkout -b <your feature branch name>
   ```

4. Make as many changes as you need in your feature branch. You can use the following commands per commit message.

   ```shell
   git add .
   git status
   git commit -m <your commit message>
   ```

5. Once your feature is ready and you're ready to merge into the main branch first make sure to push your local branch changes to GitHub's computers.

   ```shell
   git push --set-upstream origin <your feature branch name>
   ```

6. Go to https://github.com/kbventures/ecommerce/branches and you should see your newly pushed feature branch. Find and click the button "New pull request" to request for your changes to be "pulled" into the main branch.

7. When you click the button, complete the form required for each pull request and click "Create pull request".

8. In the top-right corner click "Reviewers" and add one person on the team as a reviewer for the pull request.

9. Once the Reviewer has looked at your pull request and verified everything is OK, they will merge your pull request into the main branch.

<br/>

## What if I have a Conflict?

1. From within your feature branch, fetch the latest changes from the main branch

   ```sh
   git fetch origin main
   ```

2. Rebase so that your feature branch history is stacked on top of the latest main branch history

   ```sh
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

3. Now resolve the conflicts manually in your code editor one at a time. Git will tell you which files have a conflict. Once you've resolved the conflicts run the following commands:

   ```sh
   git add .
   git rebase --continue
   ```

4. Write and save a commit message if all conflicts are resolved.

5. Push your rebased feature branch changes to GitHub's computers.

   ```sh
   git push -f origin <your feature branch name>
   ```

6. Go back to your pull request on Github your pull request should have no conflicts and you can merge into the main branch!

Also, don't forget the most important rule of rebasing:

> _NEVER REBASE ON A REMOTE BRANCH_ > <br />

## How Do I Write Good Commit Message?

Why do we care to write a good commit message? A well-crafted Git commit message is the best way to communicate context about a change to other developers working on that project, and indeed, to your future self.

A commit has two parts: a subject (max 50 characters) and a description.
Use the following command to separate a subject from the description.

```sh
git commit -m "Subject" -m "Description..."
```

In each commit message:

1. Specify the type of commit in the subject. Example: `Feat: create landing page`.

   - feat: The new feature you're adding to a particular application
   - fix: A bug fix
   - style: Feature and updates related to styling
   - refactor: Refactoring a specific section of the codebase
   - test: Everything related to testing
   - docs: Everything related to documentation
   - chore: Regular code maintenance.

2. Separate the subject from the body
3. Remove whitespace errors
4. Remove unnecessary punctuation marks
5. Do not end the subject line with a period
6. Capitalize the subject line and each paragraph
7. Use the body to explain what changes you have made and why you made them.
8. Do not assume the reviewer understands what the original problem was, ensure you add it.
9. Do not think your code is self-explanatory

<!-- FILE STRUCTURE -->

## File Structure

We are grouping by feature as listed in React docs. See [Grouping by features or routes](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html)

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- LINTING -->

## Linting

We are using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with [Airbnb rules](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb), alongside [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format code and follow modern standarts when writhing Javascript In addition, we can minimize runtime errors.
